# Analysis-and-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The project involved developing a course planner system that allowed users to load a list of courses from a file, display the list of courses, and retrieve detailed information about specific courses, including their prerequisites. The main challenges included organizing and managing course data efficiently and ensuring quick access and search capabilities for user queries.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The approach to solving the problem involved several key steps:
Data Structure Selection: Choosing an appropriate data structure was critical. I used a binary search tree (BST) to store the courses because it provides efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Understanding data structures is important because they directly impact the performance and scalability of the program.
Data Loading: Implemented functionality to read course data from a file and populate the BST. This involved parsing the file, creating course objects, and inserting them into the tree.
User Interface: Created a simple console-based menu for interacting with the user, allowing them to load data, print the course list, and retrieve details about specific courses.
Data Retrieval: Implemented in-order traversal for displaying the course list in a sorted manner and search functionality to retrieve specific course details.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
User Input Handling: Ensuring robust handling of user input, especially invalid input, was another challenge. Using input validation techniques and clearing the input buffer helped to address this.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project has significantly expanded my approach to software design and development:
Modular Design: Emphasized the importance of modular design. Breaking down the program into smaller, manageable functions improved readability and maintainability.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project has led to several improvements in my programming practices:
Code Readability: I now place a greater emphasis on writing clear and readable code. Using meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and comments where necessary makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
